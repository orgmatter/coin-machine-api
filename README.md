This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This project is intended to achieve the objectives of the author which is to design a coin-machine-api that basically creates, deposit and withdraw coins from the system.

It made use of the application Resources, Models, Controllers, Rspec and the default lightweight sqlite for data

It also was assisted by third party ruby gems such as 
-letter_opener (for quick review of emails)
-sidekiq and :redis (for sending asynchronous emails)
-factory_bot_rails
-shoulda-matchers
-faker
-database_cleaner
